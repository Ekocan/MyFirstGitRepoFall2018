Git + GitHub Day 2.
------------------

Git commands:

How to create local empty repo?

git init

How to see what changes were made in workspace?

git status

How to add changes. new files to index/staging area?

git add fileName
git add foldername
git add .
git add *
git add --all

git add "*.java" => add only .java files

How to save in local repo as a commit?

git commit -m "update some file"

How to see history of commits?

git log

How to connect local repo to remote repo in github?

git remote add origin pathToGithubRepo.git

How to do initial push to github repo?

git push -u origin master

after initial push we can just say
git push

What is "untracked" files/changes?

when you create a new file in the workspace, it is "untracked",
once you add it to staging area, or commit it then that file is no longer "untracked"
.
=============================

Login to GitHub and create an empty repository called
"Calculator".

Also Open IntelliJ and create a Java project called
"Calculator"
================

there are many websites that can store/host remote repositories:

-- GitHub
-- BitBucket
-- GitLab
-- many other that out there.

================

git, svn, cvs, etc

GitHub was purchased by microsoft and now allows unlimited private
repositories for free.
=================
Login to GitHub and create an empty repository called
"Calculator".

Also Open IntelliJ and create a Java project called
"Calculator"
================

==> Create a local repository for Calculator java project.

CybertekSchools-iMac:Calculator cybertekschool$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/cybertekschool/IdeaProjects/Calculator/.git/

==> Set up a remote repository in gitHub for local git repo?

git remote add origin https://github.com/CybertekSchool/Calculator.git

==> How to checkif remote repository successfully set up?

git remote -v

==> Add a file into project
	added calculator with one method.

==> add src folder into staging area

git add src/

==> commit to local repository:

git commit -m "write add method"

==> check history to see if it was committed:

git log

==> push local repo to github remote repo(origin):

git push -u origin master

==> Goto github and refresh the page and see if was successful
============================

Some issues so far:

1) Forgot github username and/or password:
	goto github and reset password

2) cannot push, it says no permission:

	maybe you are trying to push to someone else's remote repo.
	Owner of github repo must add you as a collaborator.
===========================

==> modify Calculator.java by adding one more method

==> check if git knows about it

git status

Changes not staged for commit:

   modified:   src/Calculator.java

==> We must add Calculator.java to STAGING area again, since it was modified

git add src/Calculator.java'

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   src/Calculator.java


==> git commit

It opens terminal based file editor (like notepad)
- anything tha t begins with #, is a comment, will be ignored

- type your commit message on top
- then hit ESC
- then :wq
- then hit enter

better alternative:

git commit -m "Add subtract method"
==============================

On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)


==> push new changes to github:

git push

then goto github refresh page and verify.
====================================


GOTO GitHub and edit the Calculator.java file and commit the
changes in the GitHub:

--> So far we were changing in the workspace then
add to staging then commit then push changes.

--> now we are changing in GitHub remote repo.

Change in GitHub repo can be done by editing the file in the browser, or maybe some other teammate/contributor pushed his
code into same github repository.

==> after commiting in GitHub,
we go to local repo and do
git pull

======================================================


IT is your first day in the Job.
And support team/lead gave you your work laptop.
And he sent you GitHub URl repo for the automation project.

You need to clone the Repository in GitHub to your machine.

=> get the repo url

=> in your computer, create an empty folder with same name as
the github repository. selenium

=> open command line(terminal/powershell/cmd) and navigate to that folder

=> clone the github repository

git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git
====================================================

https://github.com/CybertekSchool/parallel-multi-browser-testng-framework

1) clone it to our computer
2) import to intelliJ

Detailed steps:

1) Create a folder and parallel-multi-browser-testng-framework
2) Navigate to that folder in command line
3) git clone https://github.com/CybertekSchool/parallel-multi-browser-testng-framework.git
4) Open IntelliJ
5) File > Open ... and navigate to project folder
6) Click on Open

	File > New > Project from existing sources > step 6

If after import, you cannot run the tests, please do the following:

- File and close the project.
- Open IntelliJ again
- File > New > Project from existing sources
- Select Maven and follow the steps by clicking next
==================================


https://github.com/CybertekSchool/parallel-multi-browser-testng-framework.git

is a public repository. Everyone could see it in the browser
and clone to it to their machines.

Does it also allow pushing changes to it?

No, unless the owner of the github repository add you as a contributor.

What if new changes were added to that repo, can you pull those
changes?




GIT PULL command does 2 commands together.
1) git fetch
2) get merge

if any changes happened in GitHub and if you run git status,
your local git does not automatically know the new commits in the github.

If you want to see what was new, you need to fetch first.
and do git status.

git fetch
 ==> pulls all the new changes to local repository but it does not
 merge into workspace/you will not see in intellJ

 get status


Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.

fast-forward means when merging no conflicts will happen.


git merge
in this case , it merges commits that are in local repository
to workspace. If is fast-forward merge, then we are happy.
No merge conflicts happened.
